# idle-developer
An idle/incremental game where you start out as a sole developer trying to make a living by coding, until you decide to
start hiring some people to do most of the work for you.

When you start the game you'll be all alone in your office, all you have is your mouse, your keyboard, your pc and a
project, by clicking the screen you'll start writing lines of code, you can see how many you've written and how big the
project is.

Whenever you finish a project you'll get paid for it, you can then spend your money on training yourself (which will
make it so you write more lines of code per click), hiring a developer (which will code for you, giving you some lines 
of code per second), or training an developer you've previously hired(which has the same effect as training yourself)
