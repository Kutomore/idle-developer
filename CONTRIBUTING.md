# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

If you'd like to help:

* Check the [issue queue](http://github.com/kutomore/idle-developer/issues) for a
  list of the major features which are yet to be implemented.  These have the
  `enchancement` and `unstarted` labels.  If a feature you'd like to work on isn't
  there, add an issue.
* Leave a description of how you are going to implement the feature.  Failure
  to do this may lead to you implementing the feature in a way that might
  conflict with future plans, and so increase the chances of your
  work being rejected or needing a rework.

Here are some general guidelines for contributing:

* Fork the repository and clone it.
* Make your changes on a branch, and use that branch as the base for pull
  requests.
* Try to break changes up into the smallest logical blocks possible.  We'd
  prefer to receive many small commits to one large one in a pull request.
* Feel free to open unfinished pull requests if you'd like to discuss work
  in progress, or would like other developers to test it.
